# Vagrant Manager for OS X

downloads and more information available at http://vagrantmanager.com/

## Installation Notes:
• Vagrant Manager is currently only available for OS X

• Vagrant Manager is currently only compatible with the VirtualBox provider for Vagrant

• Make sure that you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, and the vboxmanage and vagrant commands are in your path so that Vagrant Manager can execute them

• Currently, vagrant machines must already be initialized in order for Vagrant Manager to detect them. Make sure you have run vagrant init on any machine you want to appear in Vagrant Manager. Once Vagrant Manager has detected a machine, you can bookmark it so that it will not disappear when you destroy the machine.

• In order to launch Vagrant Manager at login, add it to your Login Items under System Preferences -> Users & Groups
